# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis - Summary Report

## Dataset Overview
- Total records: 59
- Observations: 40
- Events: 16
- Impact Links: 20
- Temporal Range: 2011-2025

## Key Metrics (2024)
- Account Ownership: 49% (NFIS-II target: 70%)
- Mobile Money Account Rate: 9.45%
- Digital Payment Usage: 35%
- Gender Gap: 18-20pp
- Urban-Rural Gap: 24pp

## Key Insights

### 1. The Account Ownership Paradox
Despite 65M+ mobile money registrations, account ownership only grew +3pp (2021-2024).
Mobile money is complementary to existing bank accounts, not reaching new users.

### 2. The Digital Crossover Milestone
P2P transactions surpassed ATM withdrawals in FY2024/25 (128.3M vs 119.3M).
This is a historic first for Ethiopia.

### 3. Persistent Gender Gap
18-20pp gap in account ownership. Women hold only 14% of mobile money accounts.
Phone ownership is a binding constraint (24% mobile gender gap).

### 4. Infrastructure as Leading Indicator
4G coverage doubled to 70.8%. However, smartphone (24%) and mobile internet (26.9%)
remain bottlenecks.

### 5. NFIS-II Target Gap
21pp gap to 70% target. At current trajectory (+1pp/year), would reach 70% by 2046.

## Data Limitations
- Sparse Findex data (every 3 years)
- Survey vs supply-side data mismatch
- Missing agent network density
- Limited regional disaggregation

## Next Steps
Proceed to Task 3 (Forecasting) with event-based intervention modeling.
